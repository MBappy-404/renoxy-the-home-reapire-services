                         <p>SQL has been around for over 40 years, so it is recognizable, documented, and widely-used. Safe and versatile, itâ€™s particularly well suited for complex queries. However, SQL restricts the user to working within a predefined tabular schema, and more care must be taken to organize and understand the data before it is used.The dynamic schemata of NoSQL databases allow representation of alternative structures, often alongside each other, encouraging greater flexibility. There is less emphasis on planning, greater freedom when adding new attributes or fields, and the possibility of varied syntax across databases. As a group, however, NoSQL languages lack the standard interface which SQL provides, so more complex queries can be difficult to execute. Though there are many dialects of SQL, all share a common syntax and almost-identical grammar. When querying relational databases, fluency in one language translates to proficiency in most others. On the other hand, there is very little consistency between NoSQL languages, as they concern a diverse set of unrelated technologies. Many NoSQL databases have a unique data manipulation language constrained by particular structures and capabilities.</p>

                         <h2 className='text-2xl text-white'>2. What is JWT, and how does it work??</h2> <br />
                         <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object.It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties involved.The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to ensure the authenticity of the data. JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted. JWT is a token based stateless authentication mechanism. Since it is a client-side based stateless session, server doesn't have to completely rely on a datastore(database) to save session information.</p>

                         <h2 className='text-2xl text-white'>3. What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?</h2> <br />
                         <p>avaScript is a client-side scripting language that is lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted. Both Java and HTML include it. Node.js, on the other hand, is a V8-based server-side programming language.As a result, it is used to create network-centric applications. It's a networked system made for data-intensive real-time applications. If we compare node js vs. python, it is clear that node js will always be the preferred option.JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node.js, on the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the JavaScript programming language. It requires libraries that can be conveniently accessed from JavaScript programming to be more helpful.</p>

                         <h2 className='text-2xl text-white'>4. How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?</h2> <br />
                         <p>We know NodeJS application is single-threaded. Say, if processing involves request A that takes 10 seconds, it does not mean that a request which comes after this request needs to wait 10 seconds to start processing because NodeJS event loops are only single-threaded. The entire NodeJS architecture is not single-threaded. NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them. EventLoop is the listener for the EventQueue. If NodeJS can process the request without I/O blocking then the event loop would itself process the request and sends the response back to the client by itself. But, it is possible to process multiple requests parallelly using the NodeJS cluster module or worker_threads module.</p>
